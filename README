== Git Library for Ruby

= What it is

Library for using Git in Ruby.

= Roadmap

Right now I'm forking calls to the 'git' binary, 
but eventually I'll replace that with either C bindings
to libgit or libgit-thin, or I'll write pure ruby
handlers for at least some of the Git stuff.

See EXAMPLES file for, well, examples.
